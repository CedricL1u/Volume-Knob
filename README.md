A custom volume knob that you can spin to control your volume and click to play or pause. On the top, there is a LCD screen that provides appealing visuals when you change your volume or press play or pause. It uses EC11E rotary encoder switches, a Seed Studio XIAO rp2040 microcontroller, and a custom pcb.

I made this project because I have a 65% keyboard which doesn't have any volume keys. I have to press this weird sequence of keys to switch to the mode where I can change my function row keys to volume controls which is extremely annoying.

Most of the cost from the rotary encoder is because of shipping. For the waveshare, I had to order it off amazon because AliExpress shipping would arrive after Undercity.
